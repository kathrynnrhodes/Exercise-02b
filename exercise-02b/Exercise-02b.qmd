## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

This one I used my credentials in R to create the GitHub repository this Quarto was made from :)

Here is what I did: start with library(usethis) and then create_github_token() to make your PAT

Then go back to RStudio to enter it using: library(gitcreds) and gitcreds_set(). This will prompt you to paste your PAT you just made.

To make the Github repo, use library(usethis) and use-github().

Ta da! You've now made a repo that pushed itself onto Git :)

Now you have made your repo on GitHub! :D
